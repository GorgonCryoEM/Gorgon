Package: correspondence
=======================
Classes for mapping predicted secels onto observed secels.

OBSERVATIONS

ObservedHelix/Sheet/Strand
  Class that denotes indvidual helix/sheet/strand found by SSEHunter/Builder or any other 
  routine that identifies secels in cryoEM maps.

StructureObservation:
  Class that represents aggregate of the secels found in an EM map.


---------------------------------------
PREDICTIONS

StructurePrediction:
  Class that represents all of the secels predicted to exist based on primary sequence.



---------------------------------------
CORRESPONDENCES
Match.py:
  Class that maps a single predicted secel to an observed secel.

Correspondence:
  Class that aggregates a self-consistent set of matches.

CorrespondenceLibrary.py:
  Class that stores a set of correspondences and the parameters used to compute them.
