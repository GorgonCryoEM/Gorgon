# Class:  Match
# Class Description: Class that represents the mapping of a single predicted secel to an observed secel.
#		     Matches are aggregated to form a Correspondence object.

  # A forward match aligns the N-terminus with lesser vertex, and C-terminus with greater vertex
  #    lesser vertex is vertex closer to 0,0,0
