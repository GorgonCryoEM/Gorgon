 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * Mjoin( PATL, hprU ) performs the Hermitian rank 1 operation
 *
 *    A := alpha* x * conjg( x' ) + A,
 *
 * where  alpha is a real scalar, x is an n-element vector and A is an n
 * by n Hermitian matrix, supplied in packed form.
 *
 * This is a  recursive  version of the  algorithm.  For a more detailed
 * description of  the arguments of this function, see the reference im-
 * plementation in the  ATLAS/src/blas/reference directory.
