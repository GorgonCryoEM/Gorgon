 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * Mjoin( PATL, spr2U ) performs the symmetric rank 2 operation
 *
 *    A := alpha * x * y' + alpha * y * x' + A,
 *
 * where  alpha is a scalar, x and y are n-element vectors and A is an n
 * by n symmetric matrix, supplied in packed form.
 *
 * This is a  recursive  version of the  algorithm.  For a more detailed
 * description of  the arguments of this function, see the reference im-
 * plementation in the  ATLAS/src/blas/reference directory.
