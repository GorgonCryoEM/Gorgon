 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * Mjoin( PATL, tpmvUC ) performs the following matrix-vector operation
 *
 *    x := conjg( A  ) * x,
 *
 * where x is an n-element vector and  A is an n by n unit or  non-unit,
 * upper triangular matrix supplied in packed form.
 *
 * This is a blocked version of the algorithm.  For a more detailed des-
 * cription of  the arguments of this function, see the reference imple-
 * mentation in the  ATLAS/src/blas/reference directory.
