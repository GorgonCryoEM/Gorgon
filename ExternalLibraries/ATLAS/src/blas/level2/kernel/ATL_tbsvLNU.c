 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * Mjoin( PATL, tbsvLNU ) solves the following triangular system of equations
 *
 *    A * x = b,
 *
 * where b and x are n-element vectors and  A  is an n by n  unit, lower
 * triangular band matrix, with ( k + 1 ) diagonals.
 *
 * No test for  singularity  or  near-singularity  is included  in  this
 * routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.
 *
 * This is a  recursive  version of the  algorithm.  For a more detailed
 * description of  the arguments of this function, see the reference im-
 * plementation in the  ATLAS/src/blas/reference directory.
