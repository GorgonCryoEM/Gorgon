/*
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_Sgescal recursively  builds  the binary tasks tree to be threaded
 * for the matrix scale operation.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * PTYPE   (input)                       const PT_MISC_TYPE_T *
 *         On entry, PTYPE  points  to the data structure containing the
 *         type information.
 *
 * NODE    (input)                       const unsigned int
 *         On entry, NODE specifies the current node number.
 *
 * THREADS (input)                       const unsigned int
 *         On entry, THREADS  specifies the number of threads to be used
 *         for the current operation.
 *
 * ATTR    (input)                       pthread_attr_t *
 *         On entry, ATTR  specifies  the  thread attribute object to be
 *         used for the node functions to be threaded.
 *
 * NB      (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, NB  specifies  the  blocksize  to  be  used for the
 *         problem size partitioning.
