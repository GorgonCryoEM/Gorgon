)
{
/*
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * ATL_thread_init initializes the pthread library.
 *
 * By default, threads are created joinable and scheduled within  system
 * scope. From "Pthreads Programming", B. Nichols & al., O Reilly, 1996:
 *
 * A  thread  detached state can be joinable  (PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE),
 * or it can be detached (PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED).  The following  call
 * to the   pthread_attr_setdetachstate  function  adjusts  the detached
 * state of a thread.
 *
 * A thread can use system-scope scheduling  (PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM),  in
 * which  case  the  operating  system  compares  the  priorities of all
 * runnable  threads of all processes systemwide to select a  thread  to
 * run  on an available CPU.  Alternatively,  it  can  use process-scope
 * scheduling (PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS),  in  which  case only the highest
 * priority runnable  thread  in a  process competes against the highest
 * priority   threads  of  other  processes  in  the  system  scheduling
 * activity. The following function call adjusts the scheduling scope of
 * a thread.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * ATTR    (output)                      pthread_attr_t *
 *         On exit,  ATTR  specifies  the  thread attribute object to be
 *         initialized.
