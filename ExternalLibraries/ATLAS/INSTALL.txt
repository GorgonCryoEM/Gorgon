Before doing anything, scope the ATLAS errata file for known errors/problems:
   http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html
and apply any bug fixes/workarounds you find there.

Note that the documentation on the website will repeat most of this
information, and will be much more current.  The docs in this tarfile
are here mainly for convenience and for users not connected to the net.
Others should scope the website for the most current documentation:
   http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/faq.html#doc

If you are a Windows (95/98/NT/2K/XP) user please read ATLAS/doc/Windows.txt
before proceeding.

There are two mandatory steps to ATLAS installation, config & install, as
well as one optional step, sanity test.

********************************** CONFIG *************************************
From the ATLAS/ directory, create the necessary make include file by typing:
   make config CC=<ANSI C compiler>
If CC is not supplied, gcc is used by default.  If your system has gcc, you
can therefore simply type:
   make

Config then prompts you for input, and provides all required instructions.
This invocation gets the default compilers and flags.  See the FAQ
for further documentation if you do not want the default compiler and flags.
You can also get some help on command-line switches with:
      make xconfig ./xconfig --help


********************************** INSTALL ************************************
If config finishes without error, start the install process by:
   make install arch=<arch>
where <arch> is the architecture name you chose in config (config prints this
out at the last, if you have forgotten it).

Install times vary widely, depending largely on the speed of your compiler.
Under gcc/linux, an install may take as little as 15 minutes for all four
types/precisions.  Under IRIX using SGI's rather slow (but high performance)
compilers, the install might take as long as four hours.  1-2 hours is probably
fairly typical.  However, the user is not required to enter any input during
the install phase, and all operations are logged, so it is safe to start the
install and ignore it until completion.

If you experience problems, read the TROUBLESHOOTING section in
ATLAS/doc/TroubleShoot.txt.  ATLAS/README provides an index of all
included ATLAS documentation files.

You should then read ATLAS/doc/TestTime.txt for instructions on testing
and timing your installation.

******************************* SANITY TEST ***********************************
This optional step merely verifies that the install done previously has
resulted in a normal library.  It has the same format as the install step,
but substitute "sanity_test" for "install", i.e.:
   make sanity_test arch=<arch>

If you have elected to build the threaded library, you can run the same tests
with the threaded library with:
   make ptsanity_test arch=<arch>

A successful sanity test will dump a lot of compilation to the window, followed
with something like:

===========================================================================

Note that the "Error 1 (ignored)" is coming from grepping for failure, and
grep is saying it doesn't find any . . .


******************* INSTALLING ATLAS FOR MULTIPLE ARCHITECTURES ***************
If you are installing ATLAS for multiple architectures, you can run all
installs in parallel (i.e., you can be installing for two or more architectures
at the same time).  However, the config steps must be done sequentially.

Therefore, if you wanted to install for two architectures, you must run
config for architecture A, and then start the install, then run config
for arch B;  you may now start the install for arch B even while arch A's
install is still ongoing.
