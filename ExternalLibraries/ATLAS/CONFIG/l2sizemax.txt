ATLAS probed the system and determined that the following amount of memory
(in kilobytes) would be required to completely flush the cache of your
system.  However, this amount of memory may cause swapping if you don't
have enough physical memory available.  Some timers may use 3 times this
much memory purely for cache flushing (not including operands being timed).
So, if this value looks too large, decrease it (meaning ATLAS may not tune
itself perfectly since some operands will be cache resident), otherwise
hit enter to install with default.  If this causes the ATLAS timers to
swap, you can always reinstall and supply a smaller value for this entry.
