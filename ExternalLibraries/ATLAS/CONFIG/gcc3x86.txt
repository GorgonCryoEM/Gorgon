ATLAS has detected that you are running on an x86 architecture
(eg., Athlon, P4, PIII, etc), but do not have a pre-2.96 gcc installed.
Using gcc 3/2.96 will result in a performance loss of 10-20% IN THE BEST CASE
over a gcc previous to 2.96.  If your install goes slightly wrong, performance
drops of 50% are more normal with these compilers.  Full details of this
problem can be found at:
   http://www.cs.utk.edu/~rwhaley/ATLAS/gcc30.html
In the meantime, we suggest you abondon this ATLAS install, and install a gcc
that delivers decent x86 performance, and restart the install then.  You
do not need to be root to install, and full instructions, along with all
needed files, are given in the ATLAS errata file at:
