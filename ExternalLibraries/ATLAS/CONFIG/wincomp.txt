Welcome to the ugly kludge atop the festering pile of makeshift code!

ATLAS is about to create a wrapper routine in your /usr/local/bin directory
around your windows compiler that makes it behave like a unix compiler.  To
do this, it needs the full path to your windows compiler.  Notice that the
default path below uses unix-style / rather than windows style path slashes:
please use the unix-style slashes if you must change the default path.  If
you mess up the path, you will get another shot at it until you give up.

You will probably also need to set the LIB environment variable if it's
not already set appropriately to allow command-line linking using these
compilers.  You want to build up your LIB variable with the union of
all the compilers you are using.  For MVC that is something like:
   export LIB="C:/Program Files/Microsoft Developer Studio/VC98/LIB;"
Now if CVF would require the MSV lib, plus it's own:
   export LIB="C:/Program Files/Microsoft Developer Studio/DF98/LIB;"$LIB
If you are using the Intel compiler, you'd need all of these, plus
something like:
   export LIB="C:/Program Files/Intel/CPP/COMPILER80/Ia32/Lib;"$LIB
If this is causing all wrapper build to fail, you will have to quit config
and set it (maybe put it in your ~/.profile), and then run config again.
See the errata for more help if this doesn't do it for you.
