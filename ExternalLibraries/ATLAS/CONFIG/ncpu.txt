Config was unable to determine the number of processors your system
possesses.  This information is needed as part of the architecture
name, and can be helpful when optimizing the threaded code.  If
you know how many processors your system possesses, enter it below.
Otherwise, accept the default of 0, and ATLAS will empirically
detect the number of processors to use later on in the install
process.
