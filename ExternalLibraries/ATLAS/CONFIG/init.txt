Configure will ask a series of questions, in one of two forms.  The first form
of question is a menu of choices.  One option in almost all menus is
'Other/UNKNOWN'.  If you are unsure of the answer, always choose this option.
The second form of question is a single line, with a default answer shown in
square braces.  If you hit return without typing anything, this default answer
will be used.  Again, if you are unsure of the answer, simply accept the
default.

ATLAS can detect almost everything it needs to know, so choosing the default
or 'Other/UNKNOWN' will at worst simply extend the install time (if you tell
config the answer to something ATLAS can skip some tests).

Configure makes no changes to the state of things until all questions have
been asked and answered.  Therefore, if you get confused and want to start
over, feel free to break out of this program (CTRL-C, CTRL-BREAK, etc)
and start again.  Alternatively, if you make a mistake you can finish the
configure process, and then edit the created make include file by hand to fix
the mistake manually (the name and location of this file will be printed
out at the end of configure).

If you have problems during configure or installation, consult the file
'ATLAS/README/TroubleShoot.txt'.
