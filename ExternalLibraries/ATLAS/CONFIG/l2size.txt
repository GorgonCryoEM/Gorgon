This next value is the size, in kilobytes, that ATLAS must read/write in order
to completely flush your largest cache.  ATLAS will flush this much memory
between timing calls, in order to ensure timings are not inflated by
cache preloading.  A safe maximum is usually twice the size of your actual
largest cache size.  If you do not know the size of your largest cache,
a maximum value is fine.  The only drawback to making this value large
is that it requires more memory to do timings, and may slow down
the install process (if you have only a small amount of memory, it can also
invalidate the timings by causing the timers to swap).  The default given
below is ATLAS's idea of either the maximum cache your system could have, or
the maximum ATLAS believes it is safe to flush.  If you are certain that
your largest cache is smaller than the default given below, expedite the
install by changing it.  If you are certain you have enough memory to
support the necessary memory demands without swapping, and the value
is not twice the size of your largest cache, increase it.  Otherwise, just
hit enter to continue.
