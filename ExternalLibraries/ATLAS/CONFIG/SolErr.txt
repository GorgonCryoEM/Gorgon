There is a compiler error in Sun WorkShop cc 5.0 (and the 4.X versions as well),
which causes ATLAS's Level 3 BLAS routines to bus error.

Should have any new information on this bug.  In the meantime, the error
goes away if you compile these routines with gcc.  If you have gcc on your
machine, use it for this compilation.  Otherwise, be aware that the some
of the BLAS may fail.
