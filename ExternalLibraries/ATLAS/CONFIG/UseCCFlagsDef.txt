ATLAS has architectural defaults for this platform.  They were
built with the compiler flags you see above, instead of the ones you have
chosen.  At this stage, you have several options.  You can quit this install,
and run again letting ATLAS choose the default flags.  Another option is
to proceed with the install, but not use the architectural defaults.  Finally,
if you are convinced that your flags won't change the arch defaults,
you can continue the install using your flags and the arch defaults.  Unless
you really know what you are doing, quit and use the default flags.  If you
choose another course of action, we recommend you build the default library
later, and make sure the performance of both installs is roughly the same.
A quick and dirty comparison may be made by examining each install's:
