ATLAS has detected that you are installing on a Linux/PPCG4 platform,
but do not have gcc 3.3 or newer where ATLAS can find it. If you have gcc 3.3
installed, but ATLAS is not finding it, quit this install, put gcc 3.3 in
your path, and restart the install.  Installing without gcc 3.3 may result
in all of the AltiVec code producing incorrect answers, as well as an
extremely extended install time.  It is highly recommended that you first
install gcc 3.3 before installing ATLAS.
