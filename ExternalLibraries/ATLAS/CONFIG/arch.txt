You need to choose a name which represents this architecture (eg. UltraSparc,
Dec21164, etc).  Do not use a generic name (eg. solaris, linux), which might
apply to different  hardware.  This architecture name will be appended to the
name of the created make include file, and appear in all subdirectories, so
don't make it longer than you like to type.  The name should follow the rules
for file names (so don't use punctuation and spaces, for instance).
