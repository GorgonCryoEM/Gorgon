#  Various C compilers, and the linker to be used when we are not linking in
#  non-ATLAS BLAS (which usually necessitate using the Fortran linker).
#  The C compilers recognized by ATLAS are:
#     CC :  Compiler to use to compile regular, non-generated code
#    MCC :  Compiler to use to compile generated, highly-optimized code
#    XCC :  Compiler to be used on the compile engine of a cross-compiler
#  These will typically all be the same.  An example of where this is not
#  the case would be DEC ALPHA 21164, where you want to use gcc for MCC,
#  because DEC's cc does not allow the programmer access to all 32 floating
#  point registers.  However, on normal C code, DEC's cc produces much faster
#  code than gcc, so you CC set to cc.  Of course, any system where you are
#  cross-compiling, you will need to set XCC differently than CC & MCC.
