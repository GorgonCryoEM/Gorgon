Kazushige Goto (goto@statabo.rim.or.jp) has developed an assembly language
GEMM which is considerably faster than ATLAS's generated code for the
Compaq/DEC alpha ev5x and ev6 architectures.  Mr. Goto has contributed his
implementation to the ATLAS project under the LGPL license (ATLAS in
general uses a BSD-style license).  This LGPL sublibrary is included via
the LGPL's clause 7.  In accordance with this clause, this screen
informs you that if you select yes below, ATLAS will use Mr. Goto's LGPL
GEMM, and thus the resulting library will also have an LGPL license.  The
modified library is stored in ATLAS/src/blas/gemm/GOTO, and the unmodified
tarfile is in ATLAS/src/blas/gemm/GOTO/libgemm-20000228.tar.bz2.
The homepage for Mr. Goto's excellent work is:

None of this lawyer-weenie junk means anything to real techies, anyway, and
laywers probably don't have a great deal of use for ATLAS, so say "yes" below,
unless a 5-10% speedup sounds like a bad idea to you.

If you use this routine on a Linux system, you can get some additional
speedup by the settings:
   setenv MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_ -1
   setenv MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_ 0
