The ATLAS team has provided a default install for your architecture.  If you
want, these default values can be used, and ATLAS can skip most of the search
for your machine.  This will greatly decrease the amount of time required for
the install, allow you to take advantage of any special features found by the
ATLAS team, and provide protection against install miscues caused by unreliable
timing results, assuming you really have the machine ATLAS thinks you have.  If
your machine is non-standard in some way, or you just want to see the ATLAS
search for yourself, you should answer no to the following question.  Otherwise,
it is highly recommended to accept the default of yes.
