Your architectural defaults do not include defaults for the
Level 1 BLAS.  ATLAS now has the ability to tune the Level 1 BLAS to
your machine.  However, this will add time to the install.  If your
algorithm utilizes the Level 2 or Level 3 BLAS to any degree, the
the Level 1 BLAS will usually be a low order term, and thus only matter
for small problems.  Therefore, if you don't think you need good performance
from the Level 1 BLAS, you can answer "no" to the question below, and ATLAS
will skip the Level 1 tuning.  ATLAS will still provide Level 1 BLAS, but
their performance may be much worse than if tuning were allowed.
