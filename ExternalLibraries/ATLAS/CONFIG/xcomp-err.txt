I can't seem to ssh your machine.  Make sure the target system name you gave
is correct.  Also, you probably need to put the name of your cross-compiling
machine in the file ~/.rhosts on the target machine.  If your login name
is different on the two machines, suffix the machine name with your
cross-compiler login name.  For instance, if I were compiling on the machine
xcomp.cs.utk.edu, and my login name there was whaley, and I was compiling for
the machine targ.bob.net, where my login name was rwhaley, I would log into
targ.bob.net, vi ~/.rhosts, and add the following line:
   xcomp.cs.utk.edu whaley
