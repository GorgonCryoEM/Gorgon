You have chosen a different C compiler than the default one ATLAS has been
built with.  For most machines, this will usually result in a substantial
performance penalty.  If you choose to do this, we strongly recommend that
you build ATLAS with the default settings as well, and make sure your
non-default compiler library gets roughly the same performance.  An easy
comparison can be made by examining each install's:
   ATLAS/bin/<arch>/INSTALL_LOG/SUMMARY.LOG
If you are not absolutely certain you want to do this, we recommend you
quit this install and try again, letting ATLAS use its default compiler
for this platform.
