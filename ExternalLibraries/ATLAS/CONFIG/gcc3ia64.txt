ATLAS has detected that you are installing on an IA64 based machine,
but do not have gcc 3.0 where ATLAS can find it.  If you have gcc 3.0
installed, but ATLAS is not finding it, quit this install, put gcc 3.0 in
your path, and restart the install.  Installing without gcc 3.0 may result
in a large performance loss, and an extremely extended install time.
It is highly recommended that you first install gcc 3.0 before installing ATLAS.
