I see you are using a DEC ALPHA.  Gcc 3.0 is the best compiler for ATLAS
for these platforms.  It appears that DEC's cc reserves several registers
(probably for use in software pipelining), that prevents ATLAS from achieving
maximal performance.  I therefore recommend that you use gcc 3.0 as for all C
compilation, rather than cc.

If you don't have gcc 3.0 installed, I recommend you do so.  Older gccs and
OSF1's cc will not yield as good performance.
