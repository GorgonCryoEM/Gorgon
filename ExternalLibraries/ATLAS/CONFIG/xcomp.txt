The requirements for ATLAS to operate using cross-compilation are as follows:

  (1) Both the cross-compiler and target system must share the filesystem
      where the ATLAS files are stored
  (2) The target system must be accessible from the cross-compiling system
      via ssh

You will need to tell ATLAS the target system's name to ssh to, eg.
cupid.cs.utk.edu.
