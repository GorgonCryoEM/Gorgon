Windows 95/98/ME does a remarkably poor job of process load balance.  If you
change the focus from the cygnus window, performance will immediately drop by
at least 1/3, and the timings will be inaccurate.  It is recommended that you
leave the focus on the install window throughout the entire install procedure.
This is not necessary for Windows NT/2K/XP.

ATLAS requires unix-style make and /bin/sh commands in order to install on a
windows system.  A fairly complete unix-style environment is available free of
charge at:
   http://www.cygwin.com/

From this website, you can download the package, get installation instructions,
etc.  You will want to download the "full" version of cygwin, which includes
compilers, shells, make, etc.  Be sure you get all the compilers you are
interested in (ATLAS requires gcc, and you will probably want g77 as well).

The installation is quite simple, involving downloading an executable and
installing with Windows' usual install procedure (you can remove it from
your machine with Windows' ADD/REMOVE if you later decide you don't want it).

Windows developers using g77/gcc as their linkers can just install ATLAS
as normal with no special options.  Users wanting to link to their ATLAS libs
with Windows-style compilers such as MSVC++, CVF, or the Intel compilers
should scope the errata entry:
   http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#WinBuild
for full details on how to tell config what compilers you are interested in.
