********************************* ATLAS TEAM **********************************
ATLAS was originally developed at the Innovative Computing Laboratory (ICL),
at the University of Tennessee, though no team members remain there now.
The ATLAS team members, and a sketch of their particular
contributions to the version 3.6 of the package, are listed in alphabetic
order below.

ATLAS has been modified to allow for outside contribution, and the
following people have contributed to ATLAS:

                                 Doug Aberdeen
       ** Work on emmerald (an SSE-enabled SGEMM) was the starting point
          for a lot of the people doing SSE-enabled kernels.


                                 Nicholas Coult
       ** Initial version of AltiVec enabled SGEMM.

                                 Kazushige Goto
       ** Assembly language GEMM for Compaq/DEC ev5x and ev6 machines. See
          ATLAS/src/blas/gemm/GOTO for details.

                                 Camm Maguire
       ** SSE enabled [S,D,C,Z]GEMM, [S,D,C,Z]GEMV and [S,D,C,Z]GER kernels, see
          ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/CASES,
          ATLAS/tune/blas/gemv/CASES and ATLAS/tune/blas/ger/CASES
          for details.

                             Tim Mattox and Hank Deitz
       ** Extremely efficient 3DNow! kernel for Athlon, see
          ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/CASES/ATL_smm_3dnow_90.c for details.

                       Viet Nguyen and Peter Strazdins
       ** UltraSparc-optimized [D,Z]GEMM kernels, see
          ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/CASES for details.

                           Pearu Peterson
       ** A lot of 3.6 stable testing.

                              Julian Ruhe
       ** Excellent Athlon-optimized assembly kernels, see
          ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/CASES/objs/ for details.

                              Peter Soendergaard
       ** SSE and 3DNow! GEMM routines.  See ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/CASES
          for details.  Also, translation of Julian Ruhe's Athlon kernels
          from NASM to gnu assembler, and extension to all precisions.
          See ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/CASES/ATL_dmm_julian_gas_30.c for details.

                              Carl Staelin
       ** Initial work on parallelizing ATLAS make.
