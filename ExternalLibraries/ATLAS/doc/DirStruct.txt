***************************** DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ******************************
NOTE: This graphic is out of date (for instance, the pthreads directory is
      not shown), but still gives the general idea.

The directory structure of ATLAS can be summarized by the following graphic:
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      |       |        |                |          |          |

              |   -----------------------       ----------------------------
              |   |                     |       |       |     |            |

              |                                               |
        ----------------------           -----------------------------------
        |                    |           |       |       |      |     |    |

At each leaf, there are sub-directories corresponding to the installed
architectures which hold the compiled object files, libraries, or executables.

A summary of each of the main directories is given below:

** interfaces : The official C and Fortran77 interfaces that ATLAS supplies.
                Users needing to examine the API can go to the appropriate
                src subdirectory.  If it exists, the official API tester is
                available in the appropriate testing subdirectory.
** bin        : ATLAS's user-runnable testers & timers are built here
** lib        : Libraries are compiled by default into this directory
** tune       : The code generators and timing programs that allow ATLAS to
                tune itself to specific architectures are here
** include    : All of atlas's include files.  Architecture-dependent include
                files appear in the appropriate <arch> subdirectory.
** src        : Stores the routines supported by atlas; once optimal cases have
                been found, this is also where the generated code is stored.

In addition to those shown above, the user should be aware of the directories:
   ATLAS/doc                    : ATLAS documentation
   ATLAS/bin/<arch>/INSTALL_LOG : Log of the config & install steps for each
                                  architecture
