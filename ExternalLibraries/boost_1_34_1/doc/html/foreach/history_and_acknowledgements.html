      History
    </h2>
<p>
      The ideas for <code class="literal">BOOST_FOREACH</code> began life in the Visual C++
      group at Microsoft during the early phases of the design for C++/CLI. Whether
      to add a dedicated "foreach" looping construct to the language was
      an open question at the time. As a mental exercise, Anson Tsao sent around
      some proof-of-concept code which demonstrated that a pure library solution
      might be possible. The code was written in the proposed C++/CLI dialect of
      the time, for which there was no compiler as of yet. I was intrigued by the
      possibility, and I ported his code to Managed C++ and got it working. We worked
      together to refine the idea and eventually published an article about it in
      the November 2003 issue of the <a href="http://www.cuj.com" target="_top">CUJ</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      After leaving Microsoft, I revisited the idea of a looping construct. I reimplemented
      the macro from scratch in standard C++, corrected some shortcomings of the
      CUJ version and rechristened it <code class="literal">BOOST_FOREACH</code>. In October
      of 2003 I began a discussion about it on the Boost developers list, where it
      met with a luke-warm reception. I dropped the issue until December 2004, when
      I reimplemented <code class="literal">BOOST_FOREACH</code> yet again. The new version
      only evaluated its sequence expression once and correctly handled both lvalue
      and rvalue sequence expressions. It was built on top of the recently accepted
      <a href="../../../libs/range/index.html" target="_top">Boost.Range</a> library, which
      increased its portability. This was the version that, on Dec. 12 2004, I finally
      submitted to Boost for review. It was accepted into Boost on May 5, 2005.

    </h2>
<p>
      Thanks go out to Anson Tsao of Microsoft for coming up with the idea and demonstrating
      its feasibility. I would also like to thank <a href="http://boost.org/people/thorsten_ottosen.html" target="_top">Thorsten
      Ottosen</a> for the <a href="../../../libs/range/index.html" target="_top">Boost.Range</a>
      library, on which the current version of <code class="literal">BOOST_FOREACH</code> is
      built. Finally, I'd like to thank Russell Hind, Alisdair Meredith and Stefan
      Slapeta for their help porting to various compilers.
